__Mike Milinkovich__

Mike Milinkovich has been involved in the software industry for over thirty years, doing everything from software engineering, to product management to IP licensing. He has been the Executive Director of the Eclipse Foundation since 2004. In that role he is responsible for supporting both the Eclipse open-source community and its commercial ecosystem.  Prior to joining Eclipse, Mike was a vice president in Oracleâ€™s development group. Other stops along the way include WebGain, The Object People, IBM, Object Technology International (OTI) and Nortel.

Mike sits on the Board of the Open Source Initiative (OSI), on the Executive Committee of the Java Community Process (JCP), and is an observer and past member of the Board of OpenJDK.

Mike spends many of his evenings playing with IoT gadgets, and getting Eclipse software running on them.

__Talk__

The Internet of Things is coming, and open source developer tools and frameworks are starting to take shape to support it. At Eclipse there is a vibrant community working on the protocols, runtimes, frameworks and tools for building IoT applications. In this talk, I will be discussing some of these projects such as Californium (CoAP client), Leshan (LWM2M server), Paho (MQTT client), Mosquitto (MQTT broker), Kura (Java+OSGi device gateway framework), and others. In addition, I will be using the Orion web-based development tool to demonstrate how you can use your browser to develop IoT applications right on your favorite open hardware device, whether it be a Raspberry Pi, Beagle Bone, or Arduino.

__Food & Drinks__

- Pizzas will be offered by the [Eclipse Foundation](https://eclipse.org/org/foundation/)
- Drinks offered by Oracle, as usual
- And we'll have an after at a pub for those wanting to continue the evening!
