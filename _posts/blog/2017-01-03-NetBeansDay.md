Hello JUG members,

We would like to promote a nice event happening for the first time in Montreal: The NetBeans day. 

It's free, about NetBeans, if course, but also a lot about Java. 

And it's January 12.

__Official announcement__

Dawson College will be hosting Montrealâ€™s first NetBeans Day. Unlike large commercial conferences NetBeans Day is a 
community organized event. It is loosely based around a central theme of NetBeans that supports a very wide range of 
languages, frameworks and techniques. The event is free to attend (with refreshments) and targeted at professional 
software developers, students and anyone with a general curiosity.

Register [here](https://www.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/netbeansday/).
