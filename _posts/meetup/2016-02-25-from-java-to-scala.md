__Martin Naumann__

Martin is open source contributor and web evangelist by heart from Zurich with a decade experience from the trenches of software engineering in multiple fields. 

He works as a software engineer at Archilogic in front- and backend. He devotes his time to moving the web forward, fixing problems, building applications and systems and breaking things for fun & profit. Speaker at multiple conferences (Canada (Coofoo), Switzerland, Norway, German, London, Romania, Germany...), Martin likes to share it experience and knowledge.

__Talk__

We previously had a remote Docker talk from Martin. This time, Martin will be in Montreal to give us a talk on how he started loving Scala and how, as a Java Developer, he moved from Java to Scala.

__Food & Drinks__

* Drinks offered by Oracle, as usual
* And we'll have an after at a pub for those wanting to continue the evening!
