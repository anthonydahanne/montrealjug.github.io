__Sluggish webapps no more with HTTP/2 and Vert.x__

Do you have that feeling that no matter how much network speed gets faster, web pages always taker longer do load? 
It's 2017 and don't we already have a solution for this? In fact we do! The solution goes through HTTP/2 and Reactive Systems.

Join us on this session and we'll discuss the limitations of HTTP/1.1 and the new improvements brought to us by HTTP/2. 
But just HTTP/2 is not enough! We need to rearchitect part of our applications to allow higher concurrency and lower response times. 
We also need to be reactive: expects lots of demos and explore how Vert.x and HTTP/2 can solve the sluggish webapps problem.
