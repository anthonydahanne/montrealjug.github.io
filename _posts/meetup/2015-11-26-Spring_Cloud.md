Talk will be in English or French, probably more in English.

__Sani Chabi Yo__

Sani Chabi Yo, Senior Field Engineer, has been working with Java/Spring for the past 8 years and is a Cloud Solution Architect for the past year at Pivotal, a company that is changing the way enterprise build software. His main interest and expertise are in PaaS, IoT and Spring technologies.

__Talk__

Microservices have become a hot topic. They are very handy to split up functionality into smaller, more maintainable systems. But that comes with a price. Is it worth it? Let see how Spring Cloud can help.

- See how to put all your configuration settings into a single, external location with Spring Cloud Config Server
- Make it super simple for your microservices to find each other (no matter how many copies are running!) with Spring Cloud Netflix
- Handle failures without taking down the entire system using Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker
- How lattice, a cloud-native application platform can help you orchestrate your microservices.

The presentation will be demo oriented.

Hope to see you all there.

__As usual__

- drinks are available thanks to Oracle.
