The Software Assurance Marketplace (SWAMP) is an open facility that is
designed, built, and operated by four research institutions. The SWAMP
provides no-cost access to an array of open-source and commercial
software analysis tools. Concretely, it is giving a way for Java
developers to upload their project and get reports on code quality
coverage, including but not limited to security vulnerabilities. Visit
