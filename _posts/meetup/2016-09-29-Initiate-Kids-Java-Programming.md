__Talk__

There are many tools on the market all with pros and cons to help make software programming more interesting, but there aren’t many methods on how to get them motivated and passionate about writing software. In this talk I will illustrate my journey on how I was able to interest kids to Java programming. Through examples I will demonstrate how I got them excited about learning to code using Greenfoot and show how simple it is to engage them in programming by creating a fun game while learning basic concepts of software engineering. 

This session is for Java programmer, who would like to share their passion with a younger generation.
