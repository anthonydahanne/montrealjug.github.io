__JavaFX is booming!__

For the past 5 years we have seen open source libraries and JavaFX projects popping up slowly, however the pace at which new projects appear has increased. 
We’ll cover a wide range of libraries that will ensure your next JavaFX project becomes a success. 
Make the most of layouts with MigPane. Spice up your control repertoire with JideFX, Medusa and ControlsFX. 
Change the looks of your application with the flick of a CSS switch, thanks to JFoenix and BootstrapFX. 
Decorate your screens with a wide variety of icons from Ikonli. And these are but a few of the libraries we’ll cover.
