__Look ma, no JavaScript – how you can build a modern web app 100% in Java (Vaadin), by Marcus Hellberg__

Building great web apps is not an easy task. User expectations keep growing, and the technologies needed to fulfill them are increasingly complicated. 

Vaadin takes a very different approach to web development. For starters, there's no need to write HTML or JavaScript. No REST services. Instead, you build your app using ready-made UI components in Java and let Vaadin handle the rest. The result is a great looking HTML5 web app that works on both desktop and mobile. 

Come find out how fun and productive web development can be. 

Vaadin is an open source web framework used by more than 150,000 developers and 40% of Fortune 100 companies - vaadin.com/framework

Marcus is a developer advocate at Vaadin, helping find, get started, and enjoy development with Vaadin. He has a background in embedded systems but has worked on everything web related for the past 11+ years.
