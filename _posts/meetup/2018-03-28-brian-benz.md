__Talk__

Iâ€™ll highlight the easiest ways for Java developers to deliver their code to the cloud and the best ways to reliably make updates and maintain production cloud code. The focus will be on real-world examples using Linux command line tools, open source tools such as Jenkins, and other free SDKs and tools available on GitHub. The examples, tools and demos that I show will be applicable to any cloud platform, and all are available on GitHub. I will show Microsoft Azure running the samples but will not be selling azure - this is a technical talk that will focus on the code.

__Bio__
